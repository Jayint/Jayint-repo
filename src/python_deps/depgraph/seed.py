"""Wheel-oracle prior — a build-essential Tool for every from-source package.

Realizes construction-enrichment cluster 1a (design 2026-07-01): the
resolver's own wheel-vs-sdist signal (``Node.build_from_source``, computed by
``wheel_oracle.risk_from_packages``) is the ONLY basis for this prediction —
no curated package->syslib table. A package with no compatible wheel needs a
compiler to build its sdist; that is the one thing this stage predicts.

This REPLACES the deleted ``seed_predicted_native`` / ``PACKAGE_TO_SYSTEM_DEPS``
path. Specific ``-dev`` headers (psycopg2->libpq-dev, Pillow->libjpeg-dev) are
no longer predicted from a table. They are recovered by: ``install_closure``
parsing the real build error (stage 4), or ``ldd_probe`` for runtime libs
(stage 4.5) — an expected coverage tradeoff, see the design doc's "What this
loses, honestly" and Risk #2. (Declaration mining, cluster 1b, is deferred —
not part of this plan.)

Pure: every "mutation" returns a NEW ``DepGraph`` (repo immutability rule).
