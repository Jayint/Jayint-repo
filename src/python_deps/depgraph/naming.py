"""Stage 2: map ``Import`` nodes to PyPI distribution names.

Realizes design sections 4.2 / 10.2 / 10.3: Python code imports *modules* while
pip installs *distributions*, so each ``Import`` node must be resolved to a
distribution root before the resolver (stage 3) can run.

This module is pure (no Executor, no I/O) and reuses the curated table in
``python_deps.import_mapping``.  Precedence follows the design's ladder (10.3):
declared manifest names outrank the curated table, which outranks the
direct-name identity fallback.
