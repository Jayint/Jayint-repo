"""Stage 3 — resolver v2: ``uv.lock``-driven Package closure.

Primary resolve source is **``uv.lock``** (the richest single uv artifact: nodes
+ versions + transitive edges + markers + sdist/wheel artifacts).  The orchestrator
(:func:`resolve_closure`) creates a throwaway uv project in a temp dir, runs
``uv lock`` (targeted at the container's python/platform) *on the host* through the
injected ``Executor`` (locked decision 1: the ``uv`` binary is invoked, never
imported), reads the produced ``uv.lock`` and feeds it to the PURE parsers below.

Pure, unit-testable parsers (no executor / no network / no uv):

* :func:`parse_uv_lock` — ``tomllib``-parse a lock into Package nodes +
  Package->Package ``requires`` edges (carrying optional dependency markers).
* :func:`native_risk_from_lock` — per-package native-build risk: a package with
  an ``sdist`` and **no wheel matching the target platform** ⇒
  ``build_from_source=True`` (also captures the chosen artifact + hash).
* :func:`parse_resolver_error` — structure a failed ``uv lock`` stderr into
  missing packages, version constraints/conflicts, and python-version incompat.

Resilience (no all-or-nothing): when the combined lock fails, the offending
roots are dropped and the lock is retried so the remaining good roots still yield
a graph; the dropped roots are surfaced as ``missing`` Package nodes (+ conflict
edges) with evidence.  A degraded ``uv pip compile`` ``# via`` parse is kept only
as a last-resort fallback when ``uv.lock`` cannot be produced at all.

Implementation note: the three parsing concerns are split into focused modules
(resolve_lock, resolve_errors, resolve_link); this module re-exports all their
public symbols and contains the orchestration layer (resolve_closure,
_pip_compile_fallback) that ties them together.
