"""Stage 4a — certified Import->Package relink from packages_distributions().

After ``install_closure`` has installed the resolved closure, the container can
report the ground-truth import-name -> distribution map via
``importlib.metadata.packages_distributions()`` (Python 3.10+). This stage uses it
to add CERTIFIED ``Import->Package`` edges that the pre-install heuristic
(``resolve.link_imports_to_packages``) missed — e.g. ``import dateutil`` provided
by dist ``python-dateutil``. Discovery only: it adds edges, never node state.

Pure parser + pure edge builder + thin executor orchestrator (repo immutability:
every "mutation" returns a NEW ``DepGraph``).
