"""Root selection for the resolver — manifest-first, scan-gap-filled, filtered.

The resolver (stage 3) needs a set of *distribution* roots to lock.  Picking the
wrong roots is what caused the "Run-A collapse": feeding non-distributions
(stdlib modules, Python-2 shims, typing-only stubs) to ``uv`` made the whole
resolve fail and produced an empty Package layer.

This module realizes the spec's "Root selection" ladder
(``docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-23-uv-enriched-depgraph.md``):

1. **Manifest first** — declared dependencies (parsed via
   :func:`python_deps.evidence.collect_python_dependency_evidence`) are the
   highest-trust roots.  They carry no import node, so their ``import_id`` is
   ``None``.
2. **Scan gap-fill** — mapped scanned imports (:func:`naming.package_roots`) are
   added only for distributions not already covered by a manifest declaration.
3. **Filter non-distributions** — stdlib modules, known Py2 shims, typing-only
   stubs, and obvious junk are dropped before anything reaches ``uv``: a name
   that isn't plausibly a PyPI distribution never becomes a root.

Pure (no Executor / no network): it reads the repo on disk and an already-scanned
graph, and returns the root list.

    Conservative-skip rule (review "no silent shrink" constraint), generalized
    past the original ``extra``-only special case: a dep is excluded ONLY when
    ALL of the following hold —

    * a real ``target_env`` was given (no target -> nothing is filterable),
    * the requirement HAS a marker at all,
    * EVERY PEP 508 field the marker references is one ``target_env.marker_env()``
      actually supplies (see ``uncovered`` below), and
    * the marker EVALUATES to False against ``target_env.marker_env()``.

    Why generalize: ``TargetEnv.marker_env()`` supplies only 6 of the 12 PEP 508
    marker fields (``python_version``, ``python_full_version``,
    ``platform_machine``, ``sys_platform``, ``os_name``, ``platform_system``).
    ``packaging.markers.Marker.evaluate()`` silently fills any field missing from
    the given environment from the HOST's own ``default_environment()`` -- so a
    marker referencing e.g. ``platform_python_implementation`` or
    ``implementation_name`` would be evaluated against the HOST's value, not the
    TARGET's, making a drop decision confidently WRONG. ``extra`` is simply one
    more field ``marker_env()`` never supplies (it is inherently a per-requirement
    grouping flag, not an environment fact) -- so the same "field not covered by
    the target" rule subsumes the old ``"extra" in marker`` special-case without
    naming it specially: ``uncovered`` always contains ``extra`` alongside the
    5 host-fallback fields, and gating on ANY uncovered field being referenced
    keeps ``extra``-gated deps out of this filter exactly as before (they are
    already handled by the ``needed_extras`` mechanism above; this function must
    never re-judge them, or it would silently drop an extra's dep for a reason
    unrelated to environment).
    ``uncovered`` is DERIVED from ``target_env.marker_env()`` each call, so
    widening that method (a tracked follow-up) automatically shrinks
    ``uncovered`` down to just ``{"extra"}`` with no change needed here.

    Every other case — no target_env, no marker, a marker referencing an
    uncovered field, a True evaluation, or any evaluation error
    (``_marker_applies`` returns ``None`` on ``packaging`` absence or a
    malformed marker) — KEEPS the dep. Keeping on uncertainty is the point: an
    over-eager filter here would silently shrink the closure fed to ``uv``,
    which is worse than resolving one extra unneeded root.

    Substring matching (``field in marker``) below errs toward KEEP: a marker
    string that merely happens to contain a field name as a substring (of e.g.
    a version literal) only causes over-inclusion into ``uncovered``, which
    means MORE deps get kept, never fewer — the safe direction. Do not tighten
    this into exact tokenization; that could only ever make the filter drop
    more, which is the wrong direction for this "no silent shrink" invariant.
